# Advanced-Tic-Tac-Toe

I delicate this game for my 7 year-old cousin. It was him who gave me the idea for my first github repository ever.
In this version of tictactoe, the play field is much bigger than the originalgame. The size is 21x21 instead of 3x3. The valid coordinate is xy for x from 1 to 21 and y from a to u. For example, the coordinate for the centre Spot is '11k'.
    To win in this version, a player has to create an uninteruptted line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) consist of 5 symbols (X or O) belong to him/her.
